#Gulp vs Webpack

This is a small project which intends to compare gulp against webpack. 
At the moment I started this work I have a decent knowledge about gulp, but I don't know almost anything about webpack, so I decided to abord this comparison using the "Getting Started with Gulp" book from Travis Maynard to have an idea of a quick start. 

## Why we have Gulp?

Developers need to work fast and we don't like to repeat our selves. That is why such things like gulp exists. 

Tasks runners accomplishes those to objetives, and gulp does it in a singular way changing the previous 'configuration' approach implemented by Grunt. 

Gulp implements a code approach to define its tasks. It also uses the Unix philosofy of single-purposed plugins: 

				"Do one thing only, and do it this one thing right"
